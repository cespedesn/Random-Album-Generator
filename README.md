Random Album Generator (formerly known as 'Album Selector')

For our first web application, we decided to fetch from discogs.com's API and generate a random album. We created DOM elements programmatically, used event listeners, manipulated the API data by iterating through it, and displayed the contents. As our first project, we struggled with a few different items but it was a really good learning experience!
